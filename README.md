## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application
- **Bonus**: If you're building a full-stack app, we provide authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an auth flow

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Rest Countries React Redux](https://master--ent-web-app-react-redux.netlify.app)

## My process

- Identify semantic parts of the interface
- Test and build API requesting patterns using Axios
- Build Redux action creators and reducers
- Apply API patterns with Redux
- Identify parts of interface that could be isolated into separate React components
- Build reusable React components
- Apply components into appropriate interface parts
- Style the interface using SCSS preprocessor
- Add landmark aria and alt attributes
- Refactor the code

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox, Grid
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React custom hooks
- Redux
- Axios
- Back end data stored in https://jsonbin.io/

### What I learned

- Added to my knowledge of Redux state management system
- Extended my proficiency at React Router
- Increased my knowledge of CSS Grid

### Continued development

- I'd like to advance my skills at React Router
- I learn Redux Toolkit
- I learn TypeScript

### Useful resources

- [React Router Resource](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) - This helped me in applying navigation in my project.
- [JSON storage website](https://jsonbin.io/) - I used this website to store JSON file to imitate back end interaction
